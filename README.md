# Weather-prediction
Accurate and timely weather temperature prediction is critical for numerous sectors, including agriculture, transportation, and energy. This study explores the application of the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method, for predicting temperature values. Random Forest leverages an ensemble of decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data and features, to enhance predictive accuracy and mitigate overfitting. Historical weather 
data, encompassing variables such as past temperature readings, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and potentially other relevant factors, are employed to train the Random Forest model. The model's predictive performance is rigorously evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and potentially others like R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The findings of this research demonstrate that the Random Forest algorithm can effectively predict temperature with high accuracy, often    surpassing traditional statistical forecasting methods. Furthermore, the model's ability to handle non-linear relationships and high-dimensional data makes it particularly well-suited for complex weather patterns.
